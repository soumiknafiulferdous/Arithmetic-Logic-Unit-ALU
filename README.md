# Arithmetic Logic Unit ALU

A 4 bit ALU using 4 bit full adder and also implement the 'Carry", "Overflow", "Sign"
and "Zero" flag. The ALU has two control signal (S1 and S0), two 4 bit input (A and B), a 
single bit Carry in (Cin) and it can output a 4 bit Result and 4 flags. SSI (basic gates), MSI (only encoder, 
decoder, mux, demux and adder) is used to build it.
