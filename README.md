# Arithmetic Logic Unit ALU

It can implement the 'Carry', 'Overflow', 'Sign'
and 'Zero' flag. The ALU has two control signals (S1 and S0), two 4 bit inputs (A and B), a 
single bit carry-in (Cin) and it can output a 4 bit result and 4 flags. SSI (basic gates), MSI (only encoder, 
decoder, mux, demux and adder) are used to build it.
