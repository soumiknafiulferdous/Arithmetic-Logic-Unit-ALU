# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

- The Arithmetic Logic Unit has two control signals (S1 and S0), two 4 bit inputs (A and B) and a single bit carry-in (Cin). 
- It can show the output of a 4 bit result and 4 flags. 
- SSI (basic gates) and MSI (only encoder, decoder, mux, demux and adder) are used to build it.
